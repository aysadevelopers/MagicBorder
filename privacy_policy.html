        <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE</strong> – Required to keep the border visible while you use other apps. The foreground service runs transparently with an ongoing notification.</li>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong> – Used only to show the persistent notification allowing the user to stop or hide the overlay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All permissions are used <strong>solely for visual functionality</strong> within the app and do not involve any form of user data access, logging, or transmission.</p>
